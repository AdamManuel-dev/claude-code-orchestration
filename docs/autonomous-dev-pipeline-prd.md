# Autonomous Development Pipeline - Master Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Autonomous Development Pipeline is a comprehensive system of AI-powered agents that work together to create a self-sustaining software development ecosystem. Built on top of the task-kanban-mcp infrastructure, this pipeline automates the entire software development lifecycle from task planning through implementation, quality assurance, and deployment. By orchestrating specialized agents that handle different aspects of development, the system enables continuous delivery of high-quality software with minimal human intervention.

### Vision

Transform software development from a human-intensive process to an AI-orchestrated pipeline where:
- **AI agents handle implementation** while humans focus on architecture and strategy
- **Quality is automatically maintained** through continuous checking and self-healing
- **Documentation stays current** without manual effort
- **The codebase improves continuously** through automated optimization

### Key Value Propositions

1. **10x Development Velocity**: Parallel agent execution with 24/7 operation
2. **Consistent Quality**: Every change passes through multiple quality gates
3. **Zero Documentation Debt**: Automatic documentation generation and updates
4. **Self-Healing Pipeline**: Issues are detected and fixed automatically
5. **Human Empowerment**: Developers focus on high-level design and innovation

### Agent Ecosystem

| Agent | Purpose | Triggers | Outputs |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Planning Agent** | Monitors tasks, analyzes dependencies, creates optimal queue | Continuous monitoring | Prioritized task queue |
| **Optimizer Agent** | Breaks down complex tasks, batches small ones | New tasks in queue | Optimized tasks |
| **Claude Code Agent** | Implements code changes autonomously | Optimized tasks ready | Code commits to feature branch |
| **Lint Agent** | Analyzes code quality and security | Code changes | Fix tasks for issues |
| **Tests Agent** | Runs test suites and coverage analysis | Code changes | Test failure tasks |
| **Documentation Agent** | Identifies and fills documentation gaps | Code changes | Documentation tasks |
| **Reviewer Agent** | Aggregates quality checks and makes merge decisions | All quality agents complete | Pass/fail decision + fix tasks |
| **Git Agent** | Manages version control with intelligent commits | Quality gates passed | Commits, branches, merges |
| **QA Agent** | Runs user flow testing on main branch | Main branch merges | Bug tasks for issues |

## Core Components

### 1. Task-Kanban-MCP Integration

All agents integrate natively with the existing task-kanban-mcp system:

```typescript
interface MCPAgentBase {
  // Core MCP connection
  mcpServerUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
  
  // Standard MCP tools
  tools: {
    getTasks(filter: TaskFilter): Promise<Task[]>;
    createTask(task: TaskData): Promise<Task>;
    updateTask(id: number, updates: Partial<Task>): Promise<Task>;
    subscribeToEvents(handler: EventHandler): void;
  };
  
  // Agent-specific tools
  agentTools: Record<string, MCPTool>;
}
```

### 2. Planning & Task Management

#### Planning Agent
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Polls task-kanban-mcp every 30 seconds
- **Dependency Resolution**: Builds directed acyclic graph of task relationships
- **Priority Calculation**: Multi-factor scoring (business value, technical importance, effort, time)
- **Queue Optimization**: Orders tasks for maximum throughput

```typescript
interface PlanningStrategy {
  businessValueWeight: 0.4;
  technicalImportanceWeight: 0.3;
  effortEfficiencyWeight: 0.2;
  timeSensitivityWeight: 0.1;
}
```

#### Optimizer Agent
- **Task Analysis**: Evaluates complexity and requirements
- **Smart Decomposition**: Breaks tasks into <2 hour subtasks
- **Intelligent Batching**: Combines related small tasks
- **Context Enhancement**: Adds missing specifications

### 3. Implementation Layer

#### Claude Code Agent
- **Autonomous Coding**: Implements tasks without human intervention
- **Pattern Recognition**: Follows project conventions
- **Multi-Language Support**: Handles any programming language
- **Context Awareness**: Understands project architecture

```typescript
interface ImplementationCapabilities {
  languages: ["javascript", "typescript", "python", "java", "go", "rust", "more..."];
  frameworks: ["react", "vue", "django", "spring", "express", "more..."];
  patterns: ["mvc", "microservices", "event-driven", "ddd", "more..."];
}
```

#### Git Agent
- **Intelligent Commits**: Generates exhaustive commit messages
- **Branch Management**: Creates, merges, and cleans branches
- **History Optimization**: Maintains clean, meaningful history
- **Quality Gates**: Only commits after all checks pass

### 4. Quality Assurance Layer

- Performance regression detection
- Flaky test identification

**Documentation Agent**
- Gap detection at all levels (function, class, module, project)
- Multi-format support (docstrings, README, API docs)
- Quality assessment
- Template generation

#### Reviewer Agent
- **Aggregation**: Consolidates findings from all quality agents
- **Decision Making**: Intelligent pass/fail determination
- **Task Generation**: Creates specific fix tasks for failures
- **Learning System**: Improves decisions over time

### 5. Production Validation

#### QA Agent
