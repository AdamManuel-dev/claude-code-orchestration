# Product Requirements Document: Reviewer Agent

## Executive Summary

The Reviewer Agent serves as the intelligent quality gate in the autonomous development pipeline. It waits for all parallel agents (Lint, Documentation, Tests) to complete their analysis, then performs a comprehensive review of code changes, consolidating findings into actionable decisions. Acting as a senior developer would, it determines whether changes are ready to merge or require fixes, maintaining code quality while enabling continuous delivery.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Holistic Review**: Considers code, tests, docs, and lint results together
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Context-aware pass/fail determinations
- **Actionable Feedback**: Specific fix tasks when changes need work
- **Quality Enforcement**: Maintains high standards automatically
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves review quality over time

## Problem Statement

Code review is a critical but time-consuming bottleneck:

### Pain Points
1. **Review Delays**: PRs wait hours or days for human review
2. **Inconsistent Standards**: Different reviewers have different criteria
3. **Context Switching**: Reviewers lose productivity jumping between PRs
4. **Superficial Reviews**: Time pressure leads to shallow reviews
5. **Feedback Fragmentation**: Multiple tools provide disconnected feedback

### Impact
- **Deployment Delays**: 40% of development time waiting for reviews
- **Quality Variance**: Inconsistent enforcement of standards
- **Developer Frustration**: Unclear or contradictory feedback
- **Technical Debt**: Issues slip through when reviewers are rushed
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Junior developers don't learn from reviews

## Solution Overview

The Reviewer Agent provides intelligent, automated code review through:

### Core Capabilities
1. **Multi-Source Integration**: Aggregate findings from all quality tools
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Understand changes in project context
3. **Intelligent Judgment**: Make nuanced pass/fail decisions
4. **Specific Feedback**: Generate actionable fix tasks
5. **Learning System**: Improve based on outcomes

### Integration Architecture

  documentationResults: DocReport  
  testResults: TestReport
  
  // Timeout handling
  handleTimeout(agent: AgentType): PartialResult
  
  // Result aggregation
  consolidateFindings(): ConsolidatedReport
}

interface ConsolidatedReport {
  lintIssues: LintIssue[]
  missingDocs: DocGap[]
  testFailures: TestFailure[]

            'lint': {'error': 'critical', 'warning': 'major', 'info': 'minor'},
            'test': {'fail': 'critical', 'flaky': 'major', 'slow': 'minor'},
            'docs': {'missing': 'major', 'outdated': 'minor', 'unclear': 'minor'}
        }
        
    def deduplicate_findings(self, findings: List[Finding]) -> List[Finding]:
        """Remove duplicate issues reported by multiple agents"""

Code Changes:
{diff}

Agent Findings:
- Lint Issues: {lint_results}

- Test Results: {test_results}
- Coverage: {coverage_metrics}

Project Context:
- Architecture: {architecture_pattern}
- Standards: {coding_standards}
- Business Domain: {domain_context}

Perform a comprehensive review considering:

1. **Correctness**
   - Does the implementation fulfill requirements?
   - Are edge cases handled properly?
   - Is the logic sound and bug-free?

2. **Design Quality**
   - Does it follow established patterns?
   - Is it properly abstracted?
   - Will it scale appropriately?

3. **Maintainability**
   - Is the code self-documenting?
   - Are complex parts well-commented?
   - Will other developers understand it?

4. **Performance**
   - Are there any obvious bottlenecks?
   - Is resource usage appropriate?
   - Are queries optimized?

5. **Security**
   - Are inputs validated?
   - Is authentication/authorization correct?
   - Are there any vulnerabilities?

6. **Testing**
   - Are tests comprehensive?
   - Do they cover edge cases?
   - Are they maintainable?

Based on all findings, determine:
1. Should this be merged? (PASS/FAIL)
2. If FAIL, what specific fixes are needed?
3. What is the priority of each fix?
4. Any suggestions for improvement (non-blocking)?

Provide a structured review with clear rationale."

        else:
            return Decision.FAIL
    
    def calculate_quality_score(self, review: ReviewResult) -> float:
        weights = {
            'functionality': 0.35,  # Does it work?
            'quality': 0.25,       # Is it well-written?
            'testing': 0.20,       # Is it tested?
            'documentation': 0.10, # Is it documented?
            'performance': 0.10    # Is it efficient?
        }
        
        return sum(
